# SpiderOak Support Team scripts for users

Over the years as SpiderOak's support team has worked with thousands of users we've identified a few actions that, while rare, need to happen in special circumstances. These include gathering logs and renaming app data folders. We've worked hard to have good documentation for these things, but sometimes a script is just easier.

This repo contains scripts the support team has written so that users can download and run to perform these actions. We suggest that users always contact the support team at support@spideroak.com before using these. Alternatively, check out our [Help Center](https://spideroak.support/hc/en-us) to read more and use our interactive troubleshooters.

## All the best from the SpiderOak support team!
